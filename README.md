# Lyricize on the Spot!
As an avid user of Spotify, I like to collect the lyric cards of the songs I listen to. Even though the mobile app has a feature to create this card, the Desktop version does not. So I made this to create my lyric cards as I'm mostly on my PC and it's bothersome to go to my phone just to get it!ðŸ˜‰
